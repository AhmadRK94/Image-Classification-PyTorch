# image-classification-PyTorch
In this notebook:
  * I used PyTorch, PyTorch-Lightning, and Fastai to solve image classification tasks using both FCNN and CNN on the MNIST dataset.
  * prepare my custom dataset for the image classification task.
  * Used transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained model on my custom dataset.
