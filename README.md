# image-classification-PyTorch
In this notebook:
  * Used PyTorch, PyTorch-Lightning, and Fastai to solve image classification tasks using both FCNN and CNN on the MNIST dataset.
  * Prepare a custom dataset for the image classification task (cats and dog classifier).
  * Used transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained model on the custom dataset.
  * Used Grad-CAM to visualize how the model predicts.<br>
